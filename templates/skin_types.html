<h1>Skin Types</h1>

  <div class="skin-type">
    <h2>Dry Skin</h2>

      alt="Dry Skin Image"
    />
    <p>
      Dry skin is defined by a lack of moisture and insufficient sebum
      production, leading to a rough texture, tightness, and a dull appearance.
      This skin type can be prone to flakiness, cracking, and the development of
      fine lines and deep wrinkles. Dry skin often feels uncomfortable and may
      react negatively to harsh weather conditions or certain skincare products.
      To care for dry skin, it is essential to use rich moisturizers that help
      retain hydration and protect the skin's barrier. Ingredients such as
      hyaluronic acid and glycerin can be beneficial, as they draw moisture into
      the skin. Regular exfoliation can also help remove dead skin cells,
      promoting a smoother surface.

  <div class="skin-type">
    <h2>Oily Skin</h2>
    <img
      src="{{ url_for('static', filename='src/oily.jpg') }}"
      alt="Oily Skin Image"
    />
    <p>
      Oily skin is characterized by an overproduction of sebum, resulting in a
      shiny appearance, especially in the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin).
      This skin type often has visible pores and is more prone to acne,
      blackheads, and other blemishes due to the excess oil that can clog pores.
      While oily skin may seem problematic, it can also have some advantages,
      such as fewer wrinkles as the skin ages. To manage oily skin, it is
      important to use lightweight, non-comedogenic products that help control
      oil without stripping the skin of its natural moisture. Regular cleansing
      and exfoliation can help prevent breakouts and maintain a clearer
      complexion.

  <div class="skin-type">
    <h2>Normal Skin</h2>
    <img
      src="{{ url_for('static', filename='src/normal.jpg') }}"
      alt="Normal Skin Image"
    />
    <p>
      Normal skin is often considered the ideal skin type, characterized by a
      perfect balance of moisture and oil. Individuals with normal skin
      typically enjoy a smooth, even texture with fine pores and a fresh, rosy
      complexion. This skin type is generally resistant to irritations and
      reactions from environmental factors. To maintain healthy normal skin, it
      is crucial to follow a balanced skincare routine that includes gentle
      cleansing, moisturizing, and daily sun protection. However, it is
      important to note that skin types can evolve over time; for instance,
      normal skin may become drier as a person ages or due to changes in
      lifestyle and environmental conditions.

  <div class="skin-type">
    <h2>Combination Skin</h2>
    <img
      src="{{ url_for('static', filename='src/combination.jpg') }}"
      alt="Combination Skin Image"
      width="150px"
    />
    <p>
      Combination skin exhibits characteristics of more than one skin type,
      typically featuring an oily T-zone while the cheeks may be dry or normal.
      This skin type can be challenging to care for, as different areas require
      different treatments. For instance, the T-zone may benefit from
      oil-controlling products, while the drier areas may need more hydration. A
      tailored skincare routine that addresses the unique needs of each area is
      essential for maintaining balance and achieving a healthy complexion.
      Using gentle cleansers and targeted treatments can help manage the varying
      skin conditions across the face.

    <h2>Sensitive Skin</h2>
    <img
      src="{{ url_for('static', filename='src/sensitive.jpg') }}"
      alt="Sensitive Skin Image"
    />
    <p>
      Sensitive skin is often reactive and can be prone to redness, irritation,
      and discomfort. Individuals with sensitive skin may experience adverse
      reactions to certain skincare products, environmental factors, or
      temperature changes. This skin type requires special care, with a focus on
      using gentle, fragrance-free products that soothe and protect the skin
      barrier. Ingredients like aloe vera, chamomile, and calendula can be
      beneficial for calming irritation. It is also advisable to perform patch
      tests when trying new products to avoid potential reactions.
