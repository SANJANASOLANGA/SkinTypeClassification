<h1>Skin Types</h1>
<h2>Dry Skin</h2>
<p>Dry skin produces less sebum than normal skin. It can feel tight and rough, and may show visible flaking.</p>

<h2>Oily Skin</h2>
<p>Oily skin produces excess sebum, leading to a shiny appearance and increased likelihood of acne.</p>

<h2>Normal Skin</h2>
<p>Normal skin is well-balanced, neither too oily nor too dry. It has a healthy, clear appearance.</p>

<h2>Combination Skin</h2>
<p>Combination skin features both oily and dry areas. The T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) is typically oilier.</p>

<h2>Sensitive Skin</h2>
<p>Sensitive skin reacts easily to environmental factors and skincare products, often resulting in redness or irritation.</p>
